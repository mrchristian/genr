<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A concluding summary of headline issues from the Open Science theme of ‘software citation’. Software citation is an important building block in the future of Open Science and has run as <em>Generation R’s</em> launch editorial theme. As with all of the topics of focus on<em> Gen R </em>editorially the issue will be revisited on regular occasions as major developments occur.</p>

<h2>What is intrinsically important about software citation?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the main part it would appear to be the case that until recently no one had indexed, or cataloged, research software. If we compared this situation to the cataloging of literature, and somehow nobody had cataloged publications for the last fifty years, then this would just be unimaginable. But for software this has been the case — for the last half-century there has been virtually no widespread and systematic indexing of software, or its citation in literature. There are exceptions, and the Astrophysics Source Code Library is such an exception and worthy of mention, started in 1999. (<a href="https://ascl.net/code/all" target="_blank">ASCL >1999</a>)</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Open Science is changing this practice to one where software citation is actively being encouraged. More generally Open Science is moving into a phase, where open research infrastructures that underpin the free-flow of knowledge, are being designed to facilitate the linking of the many types of ‘digital object’ in the research lifecycle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h3>Benefits: Replication crisis &amp; improving research software</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ability to cite research software and have a record of its citation in literature that can be indexed is vital to improving the quality of research, especially in light of the ongoing ‘replication crisis’, and as importantly for the purpose of improving ‘research software’ itself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Software citation has now been receiving a concentrated focus of research development for the last six years, or so, and the results of this research work means that the practice of software citation, software archiving, and its integration into the journal publishing systems is moving at a healthy pace.</p>

<p>Table 1: An indicative list of necessary parts needed to have a functioning research software citation ecology</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h3>Moving to mandatory code submissions for journals</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although the practice of software citation has only recently become the ‘new normal’, journals have for some time been issuing guidance on how to submit code, software and how to cite software in article submissions, such as Nature (<a href="https://s3-service-broker-live-19ea8b98-4d41-4cb4-be4c-d68f4963b7dd.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/GuidelinesCodePublication.pdf" target="_blank">‘Nature Software Submission Guidelines’ 2018</a>) or AAS. Currently the submission of code and software is voluntary but what is now a recommendation will likely become mandatory within a couple of years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h3>Credit and roles</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Software differs from other media types in that changes over time, with its lifecycle for being in use ranging from half a year when something is experimental, to decades when it’s in widespread use. Not only is their longevity a defining feature, but also there are many contributors and contributor-roles to consider. It is the mutable nature of software that has seen concepts of:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"className":"list-content"} -->
<ul class="list-content">
	<li>Transitive Credit (<a href="https://doi.org/10/gc7q6b" target="_blank">Katz and Smith 2015</a>) aimed at describing a points based, share system, for contribution attribution, and</li>
	<li>CReDIT (<a href="https://casrai.org/credit/">‘CRediT Home’ n.d.</a>) schema to accommodate a wide variety of roles.</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Who needs to cite software and how to cite software</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s important to know that it’s not only ‘coders’, those who make software or modify a version release, who should be citing code. The main group who should be citing research software are researchers who are writing papers. The rule of thumb is to cite software as you would any other source or literature, and to include it in the main list of citations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:table {"className":"list-content"} -->
<table class="wp-block-table list-content">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><strong><span id="mce_1_start" style="overflow:hidden;line-height:0px"></span>Who needs to cite software</strong></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>The software maker</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Software contributor – code, documentation or in some other role</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>A contributor who has made a minor contribution</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>In software reuse</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>A person making a data set</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>An author listing a source in literature</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<!-- /wp:table -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Table 2: Who should be citing software?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The how of citing software depends on your discipline, existing workflow, or contributor guidelines for example with a journal. It is also the case that software citation is in its early days and so guidelines are still being worked out, and quite often recommendations are for a minimum standard, which you may well want to go above.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:table {"className":"list-content"} -->

<h3>For the coders</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the software making it is worth seeing the Open Science MOOC ‘<a href="https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-5-Open-Research-Software-and-Open-Source">Module 5: Open Research Software and Open Source</a>’ as this covers all the steps necessary to make your code citable. (<a href="https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-5-Open-Research-Software-and-Open-Source">Open Science MOOC, 2018</a>).</p>

<h4>A note on Software Papers</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although for ensuring replication of research citing the ‘source code’ and associated executables is going to be of more use for general purpose research. For those involved in making and designing of software and systems the ‘software paper’ deserves a mention, as it is of value for learning more about the objectives, motivations, and influences of a project. The software paper is a place where the developers of software can describe their project, and is used to have software be citable in conventional literature citation workflows.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h3>Staying up-to-date with software citation</h3>
