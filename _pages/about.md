<p>Generation R is an online editorial platform for Open Science discourse across Europe.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our guiding editorial question to approach Open Science is to take a <strong>'needs based approach'</strong> to researchers and look for replicable models that the wider community can use, either on a conceptual level or in practical implementations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This lead question makes up one part of our four lines of investigation:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":294} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The platform runs blog posts, as well an evolving and collaborative ‘<a href="/wp/category/notebook/">Notebook</a>’ format where we look to transfer our findings as learning resource to partner platforms, for example as content for: MOOCs, syllabi, guides, Software Carpentry resources, listings, or literature bibliographies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We organize our postings by theme, but not exclusively. <a href="/wp/themes/">Themes</a> can vary in time period that they will run for, but the standard time period will be six weeks. Using our Notebook we will pre-announce themes and look to collaboratively develop the ideas. Our launch theme is ‘Software Citation’ which will be followed by ‘The Decentralized Web’ in September, and by ‘Citizen Science’ for mid-October.</p>

<p>If you would like to <a href="/wp/contribute/">contribute</a> to Generation R, have suggestion for a collaboration, or have a question please drop us a line.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A series of <a href="/wp/consultation/">consultations</a> will be run to find out how we can develop the Generation R platform to best support the Open Science community. Also, to find out more about technology used, editorial and digital strategy, and development roadmap see our <a href="/wp/tech/">tech</a> page.</p>
